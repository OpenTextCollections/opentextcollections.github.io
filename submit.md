Text collections submitted to Open Text Collections should be a coherent set of curated and edited texts. While we do not give strict limits, 10 texts would be a good start. We are building conversion pipelines for ELAN and FLEx data.

If you are considering publishing a text collection, please get in touch with [otc@langsci-press.org](mailto:otc@langsci-press.org) or the regional editors listed on [the regional boards page](/regionalboards). If you want to go forward, more formal proposal guidelines can be found below.
