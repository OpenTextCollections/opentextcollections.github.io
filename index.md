# Introduction
Next to grammars and dictionaries, text collections are one of the three elements of the Boasian trilogy of language description. The platform Open Text Collections will host a selection of the best text collections. Texts will undergo peer review in the regional boards (currently Africa, South America, North America, Eurasia, Caucasus, Oceania). Accepted text collections will be available in HTML, PDF and print-on-demand books. Additionally, a data dump of the entirety of collections will be available.

We will produce at least 10 text collections during the funding period, but hope to be able to deliver many more.

# Collections
The following map shows the languages where people are currently preparing text collections for submission. Colors will be used to show the progress of the collections as they being reviewed, accepted, and published.
