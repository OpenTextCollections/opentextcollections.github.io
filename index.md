# Open Text Collections

# Introduction
Next to grammars and dictionaries, text collections are one of the three elements of the Boasian trilogy of language description. The platform Open Text Collections will host a selection of the best text collections. Texts will undergo peer review in the regional boards (currently Africa, South America, North America, Eurasia, Caucasus, Oceania). Accepted text collections will be available in HTML, PDF and print-on-demand books. Additionally, a data dump of the entirety of collections will be available.

We will produce at least 10 text collections during the funding period, but hope to be able to deliver many more.



# Funding
The project is funded by the DFG from 2023-2025 and will thereafter be funded by a consortium of research institutions similar to Language Science Press
