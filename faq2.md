What is a text collection?
</label><label class="box-close" for="acc-close"></label><div class="box-content">
A text collection is a curated and edited set of texts with interlinear morpheme translation. We can use <a href="https://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/167">On this and other worlds: Voices from Amazonia </a> as an example.
<blockquote>
This book offers a collection of twelve interlinear texts
reflecting the vast linguistic diversity of Amazonia as well
as the rich verbal arts and oral literature traditions of
Amazonian peoples.
Contributions to the volume come from a variety of geographic
regions and represent the Carib, JÃª, Tupi, East Tukano, Nadahup,
and Pano language families, as well as three linguistic
isolates. The selected texts exemplify a variety of narrative
styles recounting the origins of constellations, crops, and
sacred cemeteries, and of travel to worlds beyond death.
We hear tales of tricksters and of encounters between humans
and other beings, learn of battles between enemies, and gain
insight into history and the indigenous perspective of creation,
cordiality and confrontation.
</blockquote>
<p>
  The texts are <strong>curated</strong>. This means that they have been chosen among a larger set of texts because they are particular well suited to illustrate a certain topic or a certain genre. Random sets of opportunistic texts are not a text collection as intended here.
</p>
<p>
  The texts are <strong>edited</strong>, not naturalistic. This means that hesitation markers, false starts and self-corrections are edited out. This entails that the text given in a text collection can differ at times from the recording on which it is based.
</p>
<p>
  We require our texts to have <strong>interlinear morpheme translations</strong>, following the <a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php">Leipzig Glossing Rules</a>
